## Description
Torch is the successor to SE Server Extender and gives server admins the tools they need to keep their Space Engineers servers running smoothly. It features a user interface with live management tools and a plugin system so you can run your server exactly how you'd like. Torch is still in early development so there may be bugs and incomplete features.

**NOTE**
Because of the winetricks installation, the install process could take some time. Likewise, the first start of the server takes its time.

**SPECIAL NOTE**
When installed, the Server loads a base World and config from this repo. ONLY THIS WORLD IS SUPPORTED.
Everything which is not defined in a variable could be edited directy in the config file /config/SpaceEngineers-Dedicated.cfg and config/Saves/World/Sandbox.sbc
