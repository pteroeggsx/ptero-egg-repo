# HogWarp

HogWarp is a Work In Progress mod that adds Multiplayer functionality to Hogwarts Legacy, similar to FiveM for GTAV

This Mod requires a API key only obtainable through their Discord, see the Startup Variable **API KEY** for more info.
- Some features of the mod (Public servers / higher player counts) require a Patreon level. See their Patreon here: https://www.patreon.com/tiltedphoques

Plugins as of now **do not work** as it requires waiting on a Winetricks update - [#2150](https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks/issues/2150#issue-1993072450)
